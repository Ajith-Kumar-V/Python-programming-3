Bubble sort:
        Bubble sort is used to sort an element by comparing the pairs or set of elememnts in the array. This loop can be accesed by two for loops and a if condition generally. the first for loop will be iterated to the number of cycles the sorting should take place in the list and the inner or second for loop is used to call the elements one by one, by using if the called elements are compared and replaced if the condition is satisfied. when t outer or first for loop get stopped the entire list will be sorted. the if stateent plays a major role in arranging the list in either ascending or in descending orders.

Merge sort:
        In merge sort the given list is spliteed into two halves and splitting is continued till to the minimum length of the list and the it is sorted and a number of list are merged together to a single list.
       
Selection sort:
        In this method a number from the list is selected an it is compared to the entire list if there is any lowest minimum value then that value is replaced, normally the the index value is selected in this method for comparison and after the index is compared and sorted the index value ill be incremented.

Quick sort:
        In this method normally a pivot element is choosen from the list and the list elements are replacedbased on comparing with the pivot element and these elements are splitted as less than the pivot and greater than the pivot and it is continued tohe last where every elements are arrannged in an sorted order.
